# TravelMate

TravelMate: A travel management system that leverages C++ for efficient algorithmic processing, including the Bellmanford algorithm shortest path computation. The system offers user-friendly input and output modules, enabling users to input source and destination cities and obtain optimal route suggestions with cost calculations. The Bellman-Ford algorithm optimizes costs, and detailed e-tickets are generated, stored in files. The code incorporates object-oriented principles, encapsulating functionalities like cost declarations, user interactions, and output presentations. TravelMate simplifies travel planning, showcases algorithmic skills, and demonstrates file handling for data storage.
